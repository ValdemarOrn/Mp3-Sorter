Mp3 Sorter
==========

I made this program to help me manage and sort my collection of mp3 singles.

If you're like me and you have several thousand singles you probably want to make sure they are tagged with the correct ID3 tag and sorted by genre, or whatever organization you use. Crawling through each file, opening it in a media player, checking the tag and moving the file to the correct directory is both tedious and time-consuming, but this program can help you with that.

To use
------

Click the "Open Directory" button and select a folder which contains mp3 files and sub-folders. Ideally the sub-folders should be named by genres or something similar. The list of folders is loaded in the top grid, the list of files in the bottom one. Click each file to begin playback (or use hotkeys to scroll through them). Listen and determine how you want to categorize that song, the click the directory where you want to move it. The program will move the file into that folder and switch to the next song in the list.

If you notice the ID3 tag is missing or incomplete you can edit it before moving the file with the editor in the top-right corner.
